An AI Agent That Brings Joy Back Into Remote-Workers Life by suggesting a daily plan that contains places to visit for working and having fun.

## Features:
- Day plan generating using **Google Places API** and according to search criteria. Two plans are generated so the user can use.
- Day plan is generated according to the **activity state of the user** (i.e. motivated -> e.g. work at library / a little bit down -> e.g. work at a restaurant).
- **Validating places visits** by matching a photo taken by the user and the photo provided by the place by Google Maps.
- **Human-like generated messages** using OpenAI and GPT with temperaute > 0.
- Collecting bonus points. Just for fun üòâ

## OpenCV:
- Frontalface Cascade Classifier: to detect faces in images.
- LOCAL BINARY PATTERNS HISTOGRAM (LBPH) Face Recognizer: to be trained on faces dataset for later face id detection
- cv.findHomography(): to find feature matches between captured photos and ones provided by Google Maps in order to validate that the photo is taken in the right place.

## Web App:
All the code is wrapped in a full-stack [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) App.
